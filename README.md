# 🚀 **Banking Data Analysis: Cleaning, Exploration & Insights**

## 📌 **Introduction**  
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a banking dataset, focusing on cleaning, organizing, and examining financial data to extract meaningful insights about customer behavior, account activity, and financial health indicators.

## 🛠️ **Methodology**

### 1️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
- 🗂️ Imported raw CSV data into Excel and MySQL for initial inspection  
- 🧹 Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
- 🔄 Standardized formats of numerical and categorical variables  
- 🗃️ Structured data tables for efficient filtering and querying  

### 2️⃣ **Statistical Analysis & Outlier Detection**  
- 📊 Calculated descriptive statistics (mean, median, skewness, standard deviation)  
- 📈 Visualized distributions using histograms, boxplots, and KDE plots  
- 🚨 Detected outliers using the IQR method and visual inspection  
- 📉 Example: boxplot of Estimated Income *(insert image here)*  

### 3️⃣ **Correlation Analysis**  
- 🔗 Computed correlation matrix between key financial variables  
- 📌 Identified significant positive and negative relationships  
- 🌡️ Visualized with heatmaps and pair plots  
- 📊 *(Insert heatmap image here)*  

### 4️⃣ **Key Metrics & Insights**  
- 💰 Income segmentation (Low, Medium, High bands)  
- 💳 Relationship between credit card balances and loan amounts  
- 🏦 Patterns in bank deposits and foreign currency accounts  
- 🎯 Insights to guide risk assessment and customer profiling  

## 🔎 **Key Findings**  
- 🎯 Clear income groups correlate with loan and credit behavior  
- ⚠️ Outliers mostly correspond to high-value transactions requiring attention  
- 📉 Correlation analysis highlights important financial variable interactions  

## 🎯 **Conclusion**  
This analysis provides a foundation for improved customer risk profiling and financial product targeting. Clean data and robust statistical methods enable reliable insights, setting the stage for dashboard creation and predictive modeling.
